Welcome to the NSBE MyChapter App's Development Page

Right now, I'm focusing on the following:

- Database Initialization
- API Development
- Online Server Hosting
- A Better README
- A frontend website that interfaces with the API

Commits have meaningful commit messages, and i'll track important changes here.
